 EventHandling
  In react, event handlers receive the event object as an argument by default,
    however, when you use an arrow function directly in the onClick attribute without
    passing the event explicitly, react doesn't pass the event object to your handlers 
    function. This is because the arrow function creates a new function and calls your
    handler without passing any arguments.
